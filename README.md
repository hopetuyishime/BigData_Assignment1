## STUDENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM & PALIDROME CHECKER FUNCTIONS

Welcome to our Bigdata group assignment1 repository for the Programming Functions Task.

This project contains two main parts:

First Question 1: Student Management System
We created a Python program that:

Takes student information (name, age, and grades for 2 or 3 courses)

Calculates the average of their marks

Displays the student details along with their average grade

The program is built using separate functions for:

Inputting student details

Calculating the average

Displaying the results

Second question 2: Palindrome Checker
A simple Python function where:

The user enters a word or phrase

The program checks if it reads the same forwards and backwards

It prints:

"Yes, it is a palindrome"

"No, it is not a palindrome"

Run the Program
